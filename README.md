# Final-Project-Magnon-Polariton
How I process my experiment data for my final project. Some of the code might be whacky.

#
1. [run_s2p](run_s2p.ipynb) = to extract magnon-polariton anti-crossing curve
2. [s2p to csv](s2p_to_csv.ipynb) = to convert file from .s2p to .csv

for the sample dataset, use [this](dataset_example.rar).
